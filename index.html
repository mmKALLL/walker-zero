            Hello!
            
            This is the website of Walker 〜Path to Darkness〜
            Thank you for checking it out
            
            I am on a quest to build an immersive and responsive web game using just DOM elements!
            However, I am a bit nervous... Not sure if someone like me will be able to pull it off......
            
            Thank you for checking the page out, anyway
            
            I really appreciate it
            
            At any rate, the game is going to be awesome, and it will also be my 40th game production.
            
            Looking forward to seeing You give it a shot once it's done!
            
            If you would like to be notified when Walker 〜Path to Darkness〜 is done, you are able to enter into an almost-irrevocable notification contract by submitting an "e-mail address" into a field later in the game!
            
            Looking forward to seeing You give it a shot once it's done!
            
            All the best,
